# π

Find rational approximations of π.

![alt text](example.png "Example of Program Output")

## Why?

On my podcast we discussed several mathematicians with early approximations of π. I promised to find out own approximation, so here's the program I wrote to find it!

## Are Pi Approximations Useful?

Not really. Most rational approximations are _longer_ than their decimal approximation. For example,

`π ≈ 103638 / 32989 (3.141 592 65)`

is not much easier to remember than the actual sequence

`3.141 592 653...`

Approximations with easily chunked components like Aryabhata's approximation

`62832 / 20000 = 3.1416`

are easier (since twenty-thousand can be remembered as a single unit rather than five decimals).
